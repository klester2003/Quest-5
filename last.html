            We are a group of teenagers who are passionate playing soccer a lot. This time we decided to 
            share our skills with people who are really intersting about it. Last year ago, we just 8 teenagers playing soccer on a normal field. We would play everyday
            and never we would never get tired of doing it. One day, we saw a flyer that was about a tournament, we joined but we were not good enough t win the first place.
            This year, we decided to train to get better, but the problem is that 3 of our team members left us and they find another thing to do. we decided to go ask people who are passionate about soccer but it was hard. 
            Today, we are still trying to find people to join our team and make a great team that is going to train so hard for the First Place Trophy.
